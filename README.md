This was the first project where I had to produce a live site, I was assigned the task to build a site that sold various games and also had a trade and resell section.

## Description

In this rapport and rational I will detail and explain my design and coding process and the choices and changes I made to the final design, this assignment truly put me to the test and it has been one of the greatest learning experiences that I have gone through.

First off I am going to be brutally hones with my self, I made every mistake possible when working on this project, the final design that I am submitting is not one that I am particularly proud of but it is the one I am going with, the site is responsive to a degree and works on multiple platforms, but... the responsiveness has a long way to go.

When it comes to the design aspect of the site I no longer like it at all, but I suppose that is something everyone who is a “dev” goes through, I made changes where I deemed it absolutely necessary, for example, on the product page in the figma design file there is a review chatbox that I omitted from the project, I did this for two reasons.

One. I felt that the box was way to small and should take up a much larger space on the users screen.

Two. My technical know how was at a disadvantage, to be short I didn't know how to build it, now I could have dedicated more time to that particular part of the project, or built it as a proof of concept, but my final decision was to cut it.

Furthermore I redesign the support/contact page, it is now a dedicated page instead of a popup, the popup in my opinion did not really work and the final design while lacking feels like it could have potential.

On the subject of mobile view I completely agree with you. ( I assume it is Mo who will be reading the rapport, if not, he felt it was shit, and I agree.)
In the end I had not sufficient time redesign platform view and the result is the is the result.

Code I “borrowed”

For the media presentation on the product page I went with and borrowed a slideshow code from www.w3schools.com,

I made adjustments where necessary to fit my design, one thing that I should have implemented was full-screen mode, but due to time constraints I had to omit that.

The mobile menu I borrowed from this link: https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/MWEJEWG author: Álvaro

On this one I had to add z-index and position: relative as without it media content would lay on top of the menu and obstruct both view and touch, I went with this one because of the slick animation, It gave me a lot of ideas for my own personal project.

To conclude this rapport I will first state that everything I failed at along the way is something that I wont be doing on the semester project. I will be a lot more peculiar when choosing media content and the way I go about the coding process, as previously stated this has been a tremendous learning experience and I know feel I have a broader grasp of the subject.
